# Post Service - Eureka Client

This guide explains how to set up a Post Service, which is a Eureka Client. The Post Service handles CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for posts and includes user data mapping with the created posts.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) version 8 or higher installed.
- [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) for building the project.
- Basic knowledge of Spring Boot, Eureka, and relational databases.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd post-service
   ```

3. Build the project using Maven:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. Run the Post Service:

   ```bash
   java -jar target/post-service-1.0.jar
   ```

The Post Service will start and register itself with the Eureka Server for service discovery.

## Usage

The Post Service provides a set of RESTful endpoints to manage posts. It includes user data mapping for posts. The following endpoints are available:

- `POST /api/v1/post/add`: Create a new post, including user data mapping..
- `POST /api/v1/post/update/{slug}`: Update a post by it's slug.
- `POST /api/v1/post/delete/{slug}`: Delete a post by it's slug.
- `POST /api/v1/post/{slug}`: Read a post by it's slug.

To access these endpoints, you can use tools like `curl`, Postman, or integrate them into your applications.

## Custom Configuration

For custom configuration, you can edit the `application.properties` file in the project. You can adjust the server's port, database connection details, and other settings as required.

For database configuration, ensure you have a compatible database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and update the `application.properties` file accordingly.

That's it! You now have a Post Service that's a Eureka Client capable of performing CRUD operations for posts with user data mapping.

For more advanced usage and production deployment, refer to the Spring Boot documentation.

Enjoy managing posts with microservices!

As in the previous `README.md` files, please replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of your repository. This document provides guidance on how to install and use a Post Service as a Eureka Client for CRUD operations for posts with user data mapping.

You can customize and extend this documentation to suit your specific project requirements and needs.
