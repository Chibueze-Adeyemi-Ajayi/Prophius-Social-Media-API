# Comment Service - Eureka Client

This guide explains how to set up a Comment Service, which is a Eureka Client. The Comment Service handles CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for comments.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) version 8 or higher installed.
- [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) for building the project.
- Basic knowledge of Spring Boot, Eureka, and relational databases.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd comment-service
   ```

3. Build the project using Maven:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. Run the Comment Service:

   ```bash
   java -jar target/comment-service-1.0.jar
   ```

The Comment Service will start and register itself with the Eureka Server for service discovery.

## Usage

The Comment Service provides a set of RESTful endpoints to manage comments. The following endpoints are available:

- `GET /comments`: Retrieve a list of all comments.
- `GET /comments/{id}`: Retrieve a comment by ID.
- `POST /comments`: Create a new comment.
- `PUT /comments/{id}`: Update an existing comment.
- `DELETE /comments/{id}`: Delete a comment by ID.

To access these endpoints, you can use tools like `curl`, Postman, or integrate them into your applications.

## Custom Configuration

For custom configuration, you can edit the `application.properties` file in the project. You can adjust the server's port and other settings as required.

For database configuration, ensure you have a compatible database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and update the `application.properties` file accordingly.

That's it! You now have a Comment Service that's a Eureka Client capable of performing CRUD operations for comments.

For more advanced usage and production deployment, refer to the Spring Boot documentation.
