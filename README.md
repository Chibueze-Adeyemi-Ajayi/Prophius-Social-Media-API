# Eureka Client - API Gateway

This is a basic guide on how to set up a Eureka Client acting as a proxy, API gateway, with load balancing, circuit breaking, and bulkhead patterns, listening on PORT 8800.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) version 8 or higher installed on your machine.
- [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) for building the project.
- A basic understanding of how Spring Cloud and Eureka work.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Change to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd api-gateway
   ```

3. Build the project using Maven:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. Run the Eureka Client API Gateway:

   ```bash
   java -jar target/api-gateway-1.0.jar
   ```

The Eureka Client API Gateway will start and listen on PORT 8800.

## Usage

To use the Eureka Client as an API gateway, configure your microservices to register with the Eureka Server. The API Gateway will automatically discover these services and provide routing, load balancing, and circuit breaking capabilities.

Here's a sample `bootstrap.properties` file for a microservice using Spring Cloud:

```properties
spring.application.name=your-service-name
server.port=your-service-port
eureka.client.serviceUrl.defaultZone=http://localhost:5000/eureka
```

In the `bootstrap.properties`, `your-service-name` is your service's name, `your-service-port` is the port your service runs on, and `http://localhost:5000/eureka` is the URL of your Eureka Server.

## Accessing the API Gateway

You can access the API Gateway by opening your web browser and navigating to:

```
http://localhost:8800
```

The API Gateway provides routing, load balancing, and circuit breaking for your services.

## Custom Configuration

For custom configuration, you can edit the `application.properties` file in the project. You can change the server's port and other settings as needed.

That's it! You now have a Eureka Client acting as an API gateway, with load balancing, circuit breaking, and bulkhead patterns, running on PORT 8800.

For more advanced usage and production deployment, consult the Spring Cloud documentation.

Happy microservices development!

This `README.md` provides a basic guide on how to install and use a Eureka Client as an API gateway with load balancing, circuit breaking, and bulkhead patterns, listening on PORT 8800. Be sure to replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of your repository.

As with the previous `README.md`, you can further customize and enhance this documentation to suit your specific project's needs and requirements.
